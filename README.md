I preprocessed and combined two datasets: a flood inventory dataset and a rainfall dataset. It first cleans the flood data by removing unnecessary columns, standardizing state names, converting dates into proper formats, calculating flood durations, and ensuring numeric values for casualties and displacement. Then, it extracts the year of each flood event and aligns it with the rainfall dataset, where "SUBDIVISION" is renamed as "State." Both datasets are merged on State and Year, so each flood record receives the corresponding rainfall data. After merging, it checks for missing rainfall values, removes duplicates, and saves the cleaned, merged dataset into a new CSV file. The script also includes error handling to catch issues like missing files or columns.
